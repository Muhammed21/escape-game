      "1": {
        "question": "What is an escape game?",
        "answer": "An escape game is an immersive adventure game where participants are locked in a room or a themed space. They must solve puzzles, find clues, and complete missions to escape or achieve a goal within a limited time. It's a mix of thinking, teamwork, and exploration."

      "2": {
        "question": "Will I be locked in a room?",

      "3": {
        "question": "How long does the game last?",
        "answer": "Each escape game lasts 30 minutes, but we have a special concept as we allow all our customers to finish the rooms (as long as possible)."

        "desc": "Overfishing occurs when fish and other marine organisms are captured at a faster rate than their ability to reproduce. Today, 34% of global fish stocks are overexploited, and about 60% are exploited to their maximum. Some species, such as bluefin tuna, cod, or certain rays, are critically endangered. But overfishing does not only threaten certain species: it destroys entire ecosystems, disrupting the food chain and weakening marine biodiversity.",
        "align": "left"
      },
      "2": {
        "desc": "To combat overfishing and protect marine ecosystems, it is essential to promote sustainable fishing by choosing MSC or ASC certified fish, and by consuming less threatened species, such as mackerel instead of bluefin tuna. The creation and respect of marine protected areas allow fish populations to naturally regenerate. It is also crucial to regulate fishing techniques by banning deep-sea trawling and drift nets, while limiting quotas to prevent overexploitation. Finally, supporting artisanal and local fishing by favoring short supply chains and environmentally friendly techniques contributes to a more balanced management of marine resources.",

    "footerTitle": "Why is it important?",
    "footerDesc": "If nothing is done, our oceans could be emptied of fish by 2050. But if we act now, we can preserve marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable fishing for future generations."

One of your companions is isolated in an underwater capsule, trapped at a depth of 6,000 meters, while the rest of the team is in the cabin of the expedition ship, on the surface. Suddenly, a shrill alarm shatters the silence. Lights flicker, screens go blank... the power grid has just blown. No more communication. No control. No certainty of oxygen remaining in the capsule. Time is running out. An unknown anomaly disrupts the instruments, and strange signals emerge from the abyssal depths.

Every message, every signal could be crucial to solving the enigma and re-establishing communication. But as time passes, the messages become more and more enigmatic, and anxiety mounts.

Your teammates must act quickly, deciphering clues and guiding you through these underwater trials. Can you put the puzzle back together and regain oxygen before it's too late?"
